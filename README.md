A visual representation of the influence political correctness has on creative practioners.

I have chosen Quentin Tarantino's filmography as my dataset, as he has been known to push boundaries of political correctness throughout the years. This paper will dissect the influence political correctness has on the creation of screenplays throughout his career.
