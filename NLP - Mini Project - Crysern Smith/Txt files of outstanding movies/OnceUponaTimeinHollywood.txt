ANNOUNCER:
This man is worth $500,

and this man's
going to collect.

He's Jake Cahill,

and he lives by...

Bounty Law.

You don't ever bring them in
alive, do you, Jake?

Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

<font color="#ff00ff">[SCREAMS]</font>

What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

I'm looking
at an ugly owl-hoot

- about to get his jaw busted.

ANNOUNCER:
Whether you're dead or alive,

you're just a dollar sign
to Jake Cahill on Bounty Law.

Thursdays at 8:30,
only on NBC.

<font color="#ff00ff">[NBC THEME PLAYS]</font>

Hello, everybody.

This is Allen Kincade

on the set
of the exciting hit NBC

and Screen Gems television
series Bounty Law.

Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

don't adjust
your television sets

because, well,
in a way, you are.

To my right
is Bounty Law series lead

and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

Welcome and thanks for
taking the time

- to visit with us.
- It's our pleasure, Allen.

So, Rick,
explain to the audience

exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

Well...

actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

Say Jake Cahill
gets shot off his horse.

Now, can I fall off
a horse?

Yes, I can,
and, yes, I have.

<font color="#ff00ff">[CLIFF & ALLEN CHUCKLE]</font>

<font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>

But say I fall off wrong
and I sprain my wrist

or I... or I
twist my ankle.

Now, that can put
an undue burden on production

because now maybe
I can't work for a week.

So Cliff here is meant to help
carry the load.

Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

What, carrying his load?
Yeah, that's about right.

<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>

Join me next week on the set
of The Dick Van Dyke Show,

where I'll be talking
to comical cutups,

Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop,

That's a big fucking lie.

Rick got his driver's license
taken away

for too many

Cliff drives him

Oh, fuck.

Well, sounds
like a good friend.

- I try.
- Mm.

I wanna send you greetings
from my wife,

Mary Alice Schwarz.

Oh, well, that's nice.

Thanks a lot.

We had a Rick Dalton
double feature

in our screening room
last night.

Oh, well, that's both
flattering and-and embarrassing.

<font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>

Thirty-five mm prints
of Tanner

and The Fourteen Fists

<font color="#ff00ff">[WHIRRING]</font>

we watched Westerns.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

MARVIN: And we thoroughly
enjoyed Tanner.

Oh, that's nice.

It's really good.
And anyway, she goes to bed.

I open up a box of Havanas.

I light up, I pour myself
a cognac and I watch...

The Fourteen Fists

- Yeah.

So I came to the office
early today,

and I watched two episodes
of Bounty Law on 16 mm.

Jody Janice,

wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

$425 dead or alive.

And you brought him here
to collect.

I don't even know
where here is.

It was just
the closest place.

Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

So, bounty killer,

the name of this town
is Janicetown.

And that boy you killed...

was Jody Janice.

He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

Hmm.

Who's
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

Well, I'll be sure
and introduce you

when he gets here.

Well, not... Not...

from a canceled show

- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

it's hero besting heavy.

But what the audience sees

is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

- Uh-huh.
- You see?

it's Ron Ely.

it's Bob Conrad,

You know my wife Janet,
don't you?

Yeah.

Steer clear of her.

Now, I admire
Cassius Clay, I do.

What I admire is,
in his sport,

there's an element
of true combat.

When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

that's not two athletes
posturing.

That's combat.

Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

If you don't beat him...

he kills you.

That's beyond athletics.

That's beyond
Wide World of Sports, you know?

That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

That's what I admire.

In martial arts tournaments,

they won't let you fight
like that.

It's very frustrating.

You stand in front of a guy,

and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

But you can't.

So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

The colored boxer,

not that white
kickboxing asshole.

They do what
they need to do to win.

They unleash
as much punishment

as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

But in martial arts
tournaments,

I do to win what
they do to win.

I unleash all my power.

I kill people.

MAN: If you fought Cassius
Clay, who would win?

BRUCE: Well,
that would never happen.

MAN: But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

BRUCE:
I'd make him a cripple.

<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>

Hey, you. What's your name?

- Me?
- BRUCE: Yeah, you.

My name's Cliff.

I'm Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

- BRUCE: Stuntman?
- Yeah.

BRUCE: You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

That's what they tell me.

BRUCE: So did I say something
funny, stuntman?

- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

I'm just here
to do a job.

But you're laughing at
what I'm saying.

But I'm not saying
anything funny.

So, what do you think
is so funny?

What I think is...

you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

and I think you
should be embarrassed

to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

And I would really
enjoy closing it,

especially in front
of all my friends.

But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

That means,
we get into a fight,

I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

in a fight,
they go to jail.

It's called
manslaughter.

And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

is just an excuse
so you dancers

never have to get
in a real fight.

Okay.

How about
a friendly contest?

No punching in the face.

Two out of three.

on the ground first?

Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

He could break any horse

and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

He's not... He's not...
He's not crippled

he never had before,

I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

Up until two weeks
before shooting,

Fabian was in the part.

Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a Virginian.

That's how I got it, so...

Ah.

Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

Was it true
you almost got

the McQueen part
in The Great Escape?

<font color="#ff00ff">[♪♪♪]</font>

- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

Never met John Sturges.

So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

I almost got the part, but...

- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

a hotshot pilot.

But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

and during that
brief moment,

I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

You have other plans?

I haven't seen Berlin yet

from the ground
or from the air,

and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

You and who?

- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

That's gotta hurt.

Yeah, well,

McQueen did it,

I never had a chance.

NARRATOR: After that Musso
& Frank's lunch meeting,

Marvin did provide Rick
job opportunities

in the Italian film industry.

Rick Dalton,
Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.

Hennessy X.O on the rocks.

Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

Two words.

Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

N-Nebraska what?

Sergio who?

MARVIN:
Sergio Corbucci.

A-and who's that?

The second-best director

of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

He's doing a new Western.
It's called Nebraska Jim.

And because of me,
he's considering you.

NARRATOR:
Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.

And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim,

existing quite nicely
within Sergio Corbucci's

rogues gallery of antiheroes.

In Rome,
Rick loved the paparazzi

and the fuss
they made over him

and his Nebraska Jim
costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.

All right there, paparazzos.
All right. Take it easy.

NARRATOR: He loved the food
so much that during his stay,

Rick gained
almost 15 pounds.

But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.

In fact,
he thought the post-synced,

"every actor
speaks their own language,"

Tower of Babel shooting style

of European movies
was ridiculous.

While in Rome,
Marvin plugged Rick

into three other
Italian productions.

His second Western was

Kill Me Quick, Ringo,
Said the Gringo,

also starring Joseph Cotten

and directed
by Calvin Jackson Padget,

pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.

His third was
an Italian/Spanish coproduction

that paired him
with Telly Savalas,

titled Red Blood, Red Skin,

directed by
Joaquín Romero Marchent

and based
on the Floyd Raye Wilson novel,

The Only Good Indian
Is a Dead Indian.

And his fourth,
a Spaghetti secret agent,

James Bond rip-off-type flick
called Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!,

directed by Antonio Margheriti.

Italian sojourn
fairly profitable,

although his swank
Roman apartment

ate up a big chunk
of his earnings.

<font color="#ff00ff">[WOMAN SNORING]</font>

So as Rick returns to Hollywood
via Pan Am,

he has four new movies
under his belt,

some money in his pocket,

and his brand-spanking-new
Italian wife,

starlet Francesca Cappucci.

Hurtling through the air

towards a new life
and uncertain future,

Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.

<font color="#ff00ff">- [BABY CRYING]</font>
- Way back in coach,

working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,

Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.

He kept Rick company

during his entire
six-month stay in Italy.

However,
as the two men return home,

they've come
to an understanding.

Well, here it goes now.

With the, uh...

With the new wife, I, uh...

I just I can't afford you
anymore, Cliff.

You know? I can barely afford
my own house anymore.

So I think the plan
is to sell the house

and buy-buy a condo in-in-in
Toluca Lake, bank the money.

You know, live off it.
That type of thing.

Hopefully,
I score come next pilot season.

That's a good plan.

Yeah. You know,

by then, I'll know
if I have a career or not,

if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

So when this whole
European journey is over,

I think we've, uh...

We've reached
the end of the trail, Cliff.

<font color="#ff00ff">[SLURPING]</font>

NARRATOR: So these last
four Italian flicks,

after nine years together,

would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.

Cliff doesn't have a clue
what he's gonna do.

The only thing the two men
know of for sure:

Tonight,
Rick and Cliff will have

a good old-fashioned drunk.

Both men know, once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,

it'll be the end of an era
for both of them.

And when you come to the end
of the line with a buddy

who is more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,

getting blind drunk together

is really the only way
to say farewell.

NARRATOR: That night,
Sharon, her two houseguests

and, naturally, Jay...

all went to the West Hollywood

Mexican restaurant landmark
El Coyote,

on Beverly, for dinner.

- I get paid $1000...
- NARRATOR: At El Coyote,

margaritas and good times
were had by all, except Sharon.

Sharon was experiencing

a touch of
pregnancy-induced melancholy.

Not only that,
it was later reported

that it was the hottest night
of the year,

and it made her feel
especially pregnant

in all the worst ways.

JAY: I don't want to party anymore.
I am tired.

<font color="#ff00ff">[SLURRING]</font>
Because he got it done.

No, it's not... It's not
because he just got it done.

He had just as much time

as all the rest
of the goddamn directors.

What he did with that time...
That's what counted.

NARRATOR: At Casa Vega,
Rick and Cliff drank so much that,

when they left,
they left the Cadillac there

and took a cab home.

The greatest action director,

underrated guy of all time.

NARRATOR: Around 10,
Sharon and her friends

left El Coyote
and arrived back at her house.

SHARON: You've had,
like, 19 margaritas.

hung out a little longer,

with Abigail even playing

All right, dig it.

We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

And if you grew up watching TV,

that means you grew up
watching murder.

Mm-hm.

Every show on TV

that wasn't I Love Lucy
was about murder.

So my idea is...

we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

The people
an entire generation grew up

watching kill people
live here.

Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

been around since 1862,

you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.

Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,

and he had to roll his own.

But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

with less burn on your throat

than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

<font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>

Mm!

Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

Hm.

Better drag, more flavor,

less throat burn.

That's the Red Apple way.

So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

Take a bite
and feel all right.

Take a bite of
a Red Apple.

Tell them Jake sent you.

DIRECTOR:
And cut.

This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

I have a double chin.
All right?

Nobody notices that crap?
